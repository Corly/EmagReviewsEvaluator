Negative summary:

The product has numerous negative aspects, including issues with the Caps Lock key, a small storage space, overheating during large transfers, connectivity problems with the internet connection, and a lack of ports. Additionally, the battery doesn't last as long as advertised, its health decreases quickly, and it requires adapters to connect external hardware. The product is not suitable for programmers, lacks ports, and is not suited for coding. Users also reported annoying automatic brightness adjustment and incorrect keyboard pictures on the computer. Furthermore, the product's heavy operating system and so-called cool apps do not live up to the marketing hype. Despite being overpraised, it remains to be seen how well it performs, and it is unable to handle tasks as a mobile workstation. Finally, users experienced Bluetooth problems and unstable keyboard keys while using it, while it also has weak support for IOS applications.
